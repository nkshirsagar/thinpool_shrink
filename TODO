TODO:

1) check returns of each cmd executed, sanity checks

2) round off passed smaller size to multiple of extent side

3) allow decimals in size

4) Make use of lvm2 support for lvreduce of tdata, when available.

5) Split ranges into individual blocks if shrinking not possible without breaking range mappings.

6) Suggest smallest size pool can be shrunk to. (only possible when 5 is implemented)

7) allow shrinking different pools at same time
