TODO:

1) returns, sanity checks, and other checks.

2) round off passed smaller size to multiple of extent side

3) allow decimals in size

4) Change tdata lv also along with the pool lv to fix this issue:

[root@localhost thinpool_shrink]# vgremove thinvg 

  LV segment p1:0-4294967295 is incorrectly listed as being used by LV p1_tdata
  Internal error: LV segments corrupted in p1_tdata.

-------------------------------

5) Split ranges into individual blocks if shrinking technically possible, but cannot fit ranges as they are.

6) Suggest smallest size pool can be shrunk to. (only possible when 5 is implemented)

7) Port to rust ?
